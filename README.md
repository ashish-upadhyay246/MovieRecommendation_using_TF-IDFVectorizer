# MovieRecommendation_using_ML
In this project we use a dataset with around 4800 movies and their metadata to predict similar movies to the user.
The libraries used in this are:
Pandas- to load the dataset into a dataframe.
SciKit Learn- two functions from this module are used in our code, TfidfVectorizer() and cosinesimilarity().
Difflib- the function get_close_matches() present in this module is used to find the closest matches to the name entered by the user.
